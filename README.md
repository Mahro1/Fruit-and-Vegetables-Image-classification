# Fruit-and-Vegetables-Image-classification
Fruit and Vegetables Image classification, data were taken from Kaggle dataset and heavily remade since they weren't great, which was one of the reason I decided to work on this dataset. Remade dataset I used to train the models can be found on https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FTlOQ7s-HmbaOPEn15Rkw8p2GCRIBrCd/view?usp=sharing . Whole process is done and described in detail in uploaded jupyter notebook.
